# Infrastructure

## Introdution

This is a bundle of docker stack, and I can use it to host a warm up dependency tool cluster.
As you can see:

- It includes an elastic search cluster on latest version
- It includes a kafka cluster on latest version
- It includes a debezium postgres cluster on latest version

## How to use it?

You only need to write one line to your terminal window, like this:

```bash
bash start.sh
```
